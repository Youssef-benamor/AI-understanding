 AI Automation Basics (No-Code Tools)



Zap Bot Workflow – Automating a Repetitive Task

Below is my automation project, designed and explained as if I am programming a Zap bot robot to handle it.

---

1. Identify a Repetitive Task

Chosen Task: Sending Weekly Reminder Emails

Every week I send a reminder email to classmates or colleagues—same structure, same message.
This is time-consuming and repetitive.

So I will automate this with a Zap bot.

---

2. Outline the Steps (Manual → Automated)

Here is the task broken down into its steps:

Manual Steps (Before Automation):

1. Open Gmail
2. Write the weekly reminder email
3. Copy/paste the same message
4. Add recipients
5. Send the email
6. Repeat every week

Zap Bot Automated Steps:

1. Trigger: Every Monday at 9:00 AM
2. Action: Generate a reminder email message using AI
3. Action: Automatically send the email to a list of recipients
4. Done: Sends weekly with no work from me

3. Choose a No-Code Automation Tool

*Chosen Tool: Zapier + Zapier AI (no-code)

Reasons:

- Has built-in AI steps
- Easy triggers
- Free tier available
- Works perfectly for time-based automation

---

4. Create the Workflow (Zap Bot Program)

Here is the automation I built:

---

Zap Step 1 — Trigger (Schedule)

- Trigger type: Every Week
- Day: Monday
- Time: 09:00 AM
  Zap bot wakes up automatically.

---

Zap Step 2 — AI Content Generation

- Zapier AI “Generate Text” step
- Prompt:
  “Create a friendly weekly reminder email about completing tasks and staying on track.”
- Output: An auto-generated email body.

---

Zap Step 3 — Gmail Action

-Action: Send Email
- To: my selected email list
- Subject: “Weekly Reminder – Let’s Stay on Track!”
- Body: AI-generated message from Step 2

Zap bot composes and sends the email automatically.

5. Test the Automation

🧪Test Process

- I ran a test inside Zapier
- Zapier generated an email automatically
- I received it in my inbox
- Everything worked correctly
- No errors found

✔ Adjustments made:

- Updated the AI prompt to improve the tone
- Changed send time to 9:00 AM instead of 8:00 AM
- Verified email format

Automation is now working perfectly.

Final Result

I successfully built a no-code automation using Zapier and AI:

- It saves me time every week
- It removes manual repetition
- It helps me work more efficiently
- It fits the checkpoint requirements perfectly

This shows how Generative AI + no-code tools can automate simple tasks and improve productivity.
