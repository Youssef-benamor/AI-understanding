1. Tool Selection




​Selected Tool: Google Sheets (utilizing the built-in Explore feature).


​Reason: Accessible, no-code, and powerful AI capabilities for analysis and visualization.




​2. Data Import




​Action: Copy and paste the messy dataset into a new Google Sheet.


​Requirement: Ensure the data includes clear headers.




​3. Clean Messy Data with AI


​I will focus on the AI suggestions provided by the "Explore" tool.




​Click the Explore button (bottom right).



​Look for and apply suggested actions in the "Clean up data" panel to fix:



​Inconsistent text formatting (e.g., standardizing text entries).


​Removing leading/trailing spaces (TRIM()).


​Addressing missing values or data type errors.








​4. Spot Patterns and Trends


​I will leverage the AI for automatic discovery.




​In the Explore pane, review the Automated Insights for quick metrics (averages, sums) and correlation suggestions.



​Use the Natural Language Query box to ask focused questions:



​Example Query: "Show me the top 5 products by revenue."


​Example Query: "What is the sales average per customer segment?"








​5. Generate Easy-to-Understand Charts


​I will select the visualization suggested by the AI that best communicates the identified pattern.




​Scroll through the Suggested Charts in the Explore pane.


​Select: Choose the most appropriate chart type (e.g., a Line Chart for trends, a Bar Chart for comparisons).


​Customize: Edit the chart title and axis labels directly for maximum clarity and impact, ensuring the visualization tells a simple, understandable story.
