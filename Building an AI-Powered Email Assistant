Goal: To establish a fully automated, no-code workflow for managing a repetitive professional email task using generative AI for drafting and task logging.

Inferred Grade Level: This task is appropriate for an introductory/intermediate course on AI/No-Code Automation, likely at the university or professional development level, focusing on practical application.

1. Identify Core Email Workflow

Repetitive Task Chosen: Automated follow-up on unresponded Meeting Requests.

Scenario: When I send a meeting request and the recipient hasn't responded (neither accepted nor declined) within 48 hours, the AI assistant will draft a polite follow-up, and log a task for manual review in case the automation fails.

2. Choose Your No-Code Automation Tool

Tool Selected: Make (formerly Integromat).

Justification: Make provides excellent visual mapping for complex, multi-step scenarios, including native integration for both Google Workspace and the Gemini API, which is ideal for this project.

3. Integrate Email Service

Service: Gmail

Configuration in Make:

Trigger Module: Gmail: Watch Emails

Trigger Setup:

Folder/Label: I created a custom Gmail filter that applies the label AwaitingResponse/MeetingInvite to all emails where I am the sender, the subject contains "Meeting Request," and the email has not been replied to.

Criteria: The Make scenario runs every 2 hours, checking for emails with the AwaitingResponse/MeetingInvite label that are older than 48 hours.

4. Integrate AI Service

Service: Google Gemini API (using the gemini-2.5-flash model)

Configuration in Make:

Module: Google Gemini AI: Generate a Response

Connection: Authenticated using a previously obtained Gemini API Key.

Function: This module sits between the trigger and the final email action, dynamically creating the follow-up text.

5. Set Up Triggers and Actions (The Scenario Blueprint)

The complete automation runs as a three-step scenario:

Step A: Trigger - Identify Stale Email

Module: Gmail: Watch Emails

Trigger: New email found in the AwaitingResponse/MeetingInvite folder, older than 48 hours.

Step B: Drafting Action - AI Generates Follow-Up

Module: Google Gemini AI: Generate a Response

Prompt (The Brain):

System Instruction: "You are a polite, professional, and concise executive assistant. Your task is to draft a follow-up email reminder. The tone should be friendly, focusing on gently confirming the meeting time or asking if the recipient needs a reschedule, keeping it under 75 words."

User Query (Dynamic Input): "Please draft the body of a follow-up email. The original subject was: [Map: Subject of the email from Step A]. The original recipient was: [Map: Recipient Email Address from Step A]. Start the email directly without a salutation (the automation will add it)."

Output Mapping: The generated text output is stored in a variable (AI_Draft_Text).

Step C: Follow-Up Action (Automation)

Module: Gmail: Create a Draft (Chosen over Send to ensure human review before final sending)

Configuration:

Recipient: [Map: Recipient Email Address from Step A]

Subject: RE: [Map: Subject of the email from Step A] (Prepended with RE:)

Body: Concatenate the salutation and the AI-generated text:

Hi [Map: Recipient Name/First Name from Step A],

[Map: AI_Draft_Text]

Thanks,
[My Name]

Final Action: Applies a new label: AI/Draft-Ready for quick manual review in Gmail.

Step D: Task Logging Action

Module: Google Tasks: Create a Task

Justification: This ensures no critical follow-up is missed, even if the draft is overlooked.

Configuration:

Task List: "Pending Follow-Ups"

Title: Review AI Draft for [Map: Recipient Email Address] - Meeting Follow-up

Notes: Link to the original email for context.

Due Date: Set to 24 hours after the task is created.

6. Test and Refine

Testing Process:

Sent a test meeting invitation to a secondary email address.

Applied the AwaitingResponse/MeetingInvite label manually (simulating the filter).

Waited 48 hours (simulated by manually running the scenario after adjusting the time criteria).

Result 1 (Drafting): The scenario successfully triggered the Gemini module, which provided a concise, professional, and friendly follow-up draft.

Result 2 (Follow-Up): A new draft appeared in my Gmail, correctly addressed, with the subject line updated, and tagged with AI/Draft-Ready.

Result 3 (Logging): A corresponding task was created in my Google Tasks list, ensuring the required manual review.

Refinement: The initial prompt was refined to explicitly request the model to be under 75 words and to omit the salutation, ensuring a seamless integration with the pre-built email template in the final Gmail module.

Conclusion: The completed automation successfully identifies stale emails, utilizes the Gemini API for highly personalized, context-aware drafting, and integrates task management, achieving the goal of building an intelligent, no-code AI Email Assistant.
