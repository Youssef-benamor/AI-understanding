🚀 Introduction to Generative AI Workflow Automation (No-Code Focus)

This course is designed for professionals and developers who want to harness the power of large language models (LLMs) like Gemini to create intelligent, automated workflows without writing extensive code. We focus on practical, project-based learning to solve real-world repetitive tasks.

🎯 Course Objectives

Upon completion of this course, you will be able to:

Understand Gen AI Fundamentals: Explain what Generative AI and Large Language Models (LLMs) are, and how they are leveraged in automation.

Master No-Code Tools: Design and implement multi-step automation scenarios using platforms like Make (formerly Integromat).

Prompt Engineering for Automation: Write optimized System Instructions and dynamic User Queries to guide the AI's output (e.g., controlling tone, length, and format).

Integrate the Gemini API: Connect and configure the Gemini API within automation tools to dynamically generate text content.

Build End-to-End Solutions: Create comprehensive workflows that include triggers, AI drafting, follow-up actions, and task logging.

Title

Key Topics

Practical Application / Project

Module 1

Gen AI Foundations & Use Cases

The evolution of AI, LLM architecture overview, identifying repetitive tasks suitable for Gen AI automation.

Lab: Deconstructing a complex business process into simple automation steps.

Module 2

No-Code Automation Ecosystem

Deep dive into Make (Triggers, Actions, Data Flow), setting up connections, and environment best practices.

Lab: Building a basic data synchronization flow between two non-AI services.

Module 3

Prompt Engineering Mastery

Defining persona (System Instruction), injecting context (User Query), and output control (e.g., word count, format structure).

Lab: Crafting prompts to generate three different email tones (professional, friendly, urgent).

Module 4

Integrating the Gemini API

Authentication, setting up the "Generate a Response" module, mapping dynamic inputs from preceding steps.

Mini-Project: A tool to summarize text from a Google Sheet cell using Gemini.

Module 5

The Intelligent Follow-Up Workflow

Recreating the AI Email Assistant case study: setting up Gmail triggers based on labels and age (48 hours), dynamic subject line creation (Prepending RE:), and combining salutations with AI-generated body text.

Case Study: Build the exact "Unresponded Meeting Request Follow-Up" scenario.

Module 6

Review, Logging, and Maintenance

Implementing essential human-in-the-loop steps (Draft creation vs. direct sending), integrating Google Tasks for follow-up review, and error handling.

Final Project Prep: Defining the testing process and refinement strategy for a new automation project.

🎓 Final Project: The Custom AI Assistant

Students will design and build their own three-module, end-to-end AI automation workflow using Make and the Gemini API to solve a repetitive task unique to their professional life. This project must include an AI generation step and a task logging or human-review step.
