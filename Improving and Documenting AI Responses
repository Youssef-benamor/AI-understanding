1. What I’m Aiming For

For this checkpoint, what I’m aiming for is to develop my troubleshooting skills when working with generative AI.
Sometimes AI gives answers that feel incomplete, vague, or simply not what I meant, so my goal here is to understand how to analyze those weak outputs and refine my prompts step by step.
I want to learn how to use clarity, constraints, and better context to guide the AI toward much stronger results.
By the end, I want to be more confident not only in improving the AI’s responses but also in documenting my best prompts so I can reuse them in future tasks.

## **2. The “Bad Output” (Original AI Response I Received)**

**My prompt:**
*“Explain my product Aura Filter.”*

**AI’s bad output (summarized):**
The AI gave me a very short and generic description. It didn’t explain what the product does, didn’t mention the aura visuals, and didn’t show any creativity.
It felt like the AI didn’t understand the context of my project or the purpose of the product.
It was too vague and didn’t sound like something I could use in a presentation.

**What was wrong:**

* Too short
* Missing key information
* No target audience
* No explanation of how it works
* No marketing tone

3. My Improved Prompt (Refined Iteration)

Based on the mistakes, I wrote a better, more specific prompt:

  Improved Prompt:
“Explain my product called Aura Filter in a clear, creative marketing tone. Describe what the product does, how it works, and who it is made for.
Aura Filter transforms photos into glowing aura-style images. Keep it detailed, engaging, and suitable for a product presentation.”*

  Why this improved prompt is better:

- It gives **context** (what the product actually is)
- It sets a **tone** (creative marketing)
- It adds **structure** (what, how, who)
- It adds a "use-case" (product presentation)

4. Improved Output (New AI Response)**

**AI’s improved output:**
“Aura Filter is an AI-powered creative tool that transforms regular photos into glowing, aura-inspired artworks.
It analyzes the subject in the image, identifies edges, colors, and atmosphere, and then enhances it with vibrant glow effects such as neon, warm gold, cosmic tones, or soft pastel energy.
It’s designed for content creators, designers, and anyone who wants visually striking images without any editing skills.
Aura Filter makes it simple to generate artistic, eye-catching visuals that are perfect for social media, personal branding, and creative projects.”

  Why this is better:

* Clear explanation
* More detail
* Matches the product
* Sounds like marketing
* Useful for my campaign

5. Documentation — What I Learned & Best Practices**

From this task, I learned how important it is to be specific with AI.
The first weak output happened because my original prompt had almost no context, no structure, and no direction.
Once I added details about the product, the intended tone, and what sections I needed, the AI gave a much stronger and more useful response.

    My best practices I’m documenting for future prompts:

- Always include "context" so the AI knows what I’m talking about
- Add **constraints** like tone, length, or sections
- Use "examples" when possible
- If the first output is weak, iterate instead of starting over
- Save strong prompts so I can reuse them in future work

This simple iterative process helped me turn a bad output into a clean, presentation-ready description.
